What are sockets?
    - Sockets are the low level endpoint used for processing information across a network
    - Common networking protocols like HTTP, and FTP rely on sockets underneath to make connections

Client Socket.
    1) The client socket is created with a socket() call.
    2) connected to a remote address with the connect() call.
    3) can retrieve data through recv() call.

    socket() -> connect() -> recv()

Server Socket.
    - We need to create a socket with a socket() call.
    - bind() the ip and port for that particular socket. Specify where our socket will listen for connection instead of connecing.
    - We call listen that allows for connections.
    - accept() allows us to get another socket. return to us another socket that allows us to perform read/write operations.
